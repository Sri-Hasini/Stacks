# 151. Reverse Words in a String
- [Problem link from Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/)
## Question
## [Medium] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy(51 %)
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
## Example 1:
- Input: s = "the sky is blue"
- Output: "blue is sky the"
## Example 2:
- Input: s = "  hello world  "
- Output: "world hello"
- Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
## Example 3:
- Input: s = "a good   example"
- Output: "example good a"
- Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
## Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
- There is at least one word in s.
 
Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?
## Code in cpp:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        stack<string> h;
        string x = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == ' ') {
                if (x.size() != 0) {
                    h.push(x);
                }
                x = "";
            }
            else {
                x += s[i];
            }
        }
        if (x.size() != 0) {
            h.push(x);
        }
        string ans = "";
        while (h.size() > 1) {
            ans += h.top();
            h.pop();
            ans += ' ';
        }
        ans += h.top();
        h.pop();
        return ans;
    }
};
```
