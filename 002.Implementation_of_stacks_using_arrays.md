# Implementation of stacks using arrays
## Stack Introduction
A stack data structure is a collection that follows a specific order in which operations are performed. The order is Last In, First Out (LIFO). This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

To visualize a stack, consider a pile of books placed one on top of the other. Here's how the stack data structure would work in this analogy:
- **Adding a book (Push operation):** When you add a new book to the stack, you place it on top of the existing pile. This is similar to the "push" operation in a stack data structure. You can only add (push) a new book at the top of the pile, not in the middle or at the bottom.Removing a book (Pop operation): When you want to remove a book from the stack, you always take it from the top. This is like the "pop" operation. You can't remove a book from the middle or the bottom without first removing all the books on top of it. Popping a book off the stack reveals the book that was previously underneath it, which you can then read or pop off next.
- **Peeking at the top book (Peek operation):** If you want to check which book is currently at the top of the stack without removing it, you can take a quick look. In stack terminology, this is called a "peek" operation, where you're inspecting the element at the top of the stack without modifying the stack itself.
- **Checking if the stack is empty:** If you've removed all the books from the pile and there are none left, your stack of books is now empty. In the stack data structure, you can perform an operation to check whether the stack is empty before attempting to pop, which would be an error since there's nothing to remove.
- **Size of the stack:** The number of books in the pile at any given time corresponds with the size of the stack. As you add (push) and remove (pop) books, the size of your stack changes.

In the stack of books analogy, it's clear that you have access only to the topmost book and don't have direct access to the books lower down in the pile. Similarly, in a stack data structure, you generally only have access to the top element, reflecting the LIFO principle. This makes the stack an ideal structure for certain applications, such as undo mechanisms in software, function call stacks in programming languages, and parsing expressions in compilers.

## Push and Pop
Let's use arrays to implement a Stack. We create an array with a max size which decides the max capacity of our stack. To trace the top element of stack we create a variable top which hold the position of array where the top element is present. Initially the top variable will be -1.

1. **Push Operation:**<br>
The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the push operation:
- You have an element that you want to store in the stack.
- You check if the stack is full. If the stack has a maximum size and it is already full, this is usually called a stack overflow, and the element cannot be added.
- If the stack is not full, you place the element at the top of the stack.
- You update the pointer that always points to the top of the stack (often referred to as "top" in programming). After the push, "top" will be pointing to the newly added element.

2. **Pop Operation:**
The pop operation removes the top element from the stack. Here's how the pop operation works:
- First, you check if the stack is empty. If it's empty, there is nothing to pop, and this condition is known as a stack underflow.
- If the stack is not empty, you proceed to remove the element that "top" is currently pointing to.
- After removing the element, you update the "top" pointer to point to the new top element of the stack, which is the previous element before the one you just popped.
- The popped element is returned or kept for further processing, depending on the implementation and usage.
- Itâ€™s important to note that with the pop operation, you're typically not physically removing the element from the memory; you're just logically considering it removed by moving the "top" pointer.

## Peek, isEmpty, isFull
The peek, isEmpty, and isFull are some other functions used in stacks.

1. **peek** - This function allows you to look at the element at the top of the stack. It's a way to inspect the next item that would be removed if a pop operation were to be performed.
      - **For a stack:** Peek would return the last item added (since stacks follow Last In, First Out order).
2. **isEmpty** - This function checks whether a data structure (like a stack, queue, list, etc.) contains any elements or not.
      - If the data structure contains no elements, isEmpty returns true.
      - If there is at least one element in the data structure, isEmpty returns false.
3. **isFull** - This function is typically relevant for a fixed size stack. It allows you to determine if the data structure has reached its maximum capacity.

    else {

    // If the stack is empty (check using isEmpty function)
    // Then print "Stack is empty" and return '-1'
    // Otherwise return the element at the top
    // But reduce top before returning the element

    if(stackTop >= 0){
        int ele = stackArray[stackTop];
        cout<<"Peeked: "<< char(ele) <<"\n";
        return ele;
    }
    else{
        cout<<"Stack is empty. Cannot peek.\n";
        return '-1';
    }
}

int main() {
    string inputString = "Hello, World!";
    int inputLength = inputString.length();

    // Push each character onto the stack
    for (int i = 0; i < inputLength; i++) {
        char currentChar = inputString[i];
        pushToStack(currentChar);
    }
    cout << peek() << endl;
    // Pop the characters from the stack to construct the reversed string
    string reversedString;
    while (!isStackEmpty()) {
        reversedString.push_back(popFromStack());
    }
    cout << reversedString << "\n";
    return 0;
}  
```
